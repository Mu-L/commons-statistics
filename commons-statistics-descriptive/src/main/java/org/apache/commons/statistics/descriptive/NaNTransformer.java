/**
 * Defines a transformer for {@code NaN} values in arrays.
 *
 * <p>This interface is not intended for a public API. It provides a consistent method
 * to handle partial sorting of {@code double[]} data in the {@link Median} and
 * {@link Quantile} classes.
 *
 * <p>The transformer allows pre-processing floating-point data before applying a sort algorithm.
 * This is required to handle {@code NaN}.
 *
 * <p>Note: The {@code <} relation does not provide a total order on all double
 * values: {@code -0.0 == 0.0} is {@code true} and a {@code NaN}
 * value compares neither less than, greater than, nor equal to any value,
 * even itself.
 *
 * <p>The {@link Double#compare(double, double)} method imposes the ordering:
 * {@code -0.0} is treated as less than value
 * {@code 0.0} and {@code Double.NaN} is considered greater than any
 * other value and all {@code Double.NaN} values are considered equal.
 *
 * <p>This interface allows implementations to respect the behaviour of
 * {@link Double#compare(double, double)}, or implement different behaviour.
