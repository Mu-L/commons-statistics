/**
 * Computes the standard deviation of the available values. The default implementation uses the
 * following definition of the <em>sample standard deviation</em>:
 *
 * <p>\[ \sqrt{ \tfrac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\overline{x})^2 } \]
 *
 * <p>where \( \overline{x} \) is the sample mean, and \( n \) is the number of samples.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The result is {@code NaN} if no values are added.
 *   <li>The result is zero if there is one value in the data set.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The use of the term \( n âˆ’ 1 \) is called Bessel's correction. Omitting the square root,
 * this provides an unbiased estimator of the variance of a hypothetical infinite population. If the
 * {@link #setBiased(boolean) biased} option is enabled the normalisation factor is
 * changed to \( \frac{1}{n} \) for a biased estimator of the <em>sample variance</em>.
 * Note however that square root is a concave function and thus introduces negative bias
 * (by Jensen's inequality), which depends on the distribution, and thus the corrected sample
 * standard deviation (using Bessel's correction) is less biased, but still biased.
 *
 * <p>The implementation uses an exact integer sum to compute the scaled (by \( n \))
 * sum of squared deviations from the mean; this is normalised by the scaled correction factor.
 *
 * <p>\[ \frac {n \times \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - (\sum_{i=1}^n x_i)^2}{n \times (n - 1)} \]
 *
 * <p>Supports up to 2<sup>63</sup> (exclusive) observations.
 * This implementation does not check for overflow of the count.
 *
 * <p>This class is designed to work with (though does not require)
 * {@linkplain java.util.stream streams}.
 *
 * <p><strong>This implementation is not thread safe.</strong>
 * If multiple threads access an instance of this class concurrently,
 * and at least one of the threads invokes the {@link java.util.function.LongConsumer#accept(long) accept} or
 * {@link StatisticAccumulator#combine(StatisticResult) combine} method, it must be synchronized externally.
 *
 * <p>However, it is safe to use {@link java.util.function.LongConsumer#accept(long) accept}
 * and {@link StatisticAccumulator#combine(StatisticResult) combine}
 * as {@code accumulator} and {@code combiner} functions of
 * {@link java.util.stream.Collector Collector} on a parallel stream,
 * because the parallel implementation of {@link java.util.stream.Stream#collect Stream.collect()}
 * provides the necessary partitioning, isolation, and merging of results for
 * safe and efficient parallel execution.
