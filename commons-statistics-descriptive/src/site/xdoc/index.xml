      <p>
        Apache Commons Statistics provides implementation of univariate statistics.
      </p>

      <p>
        Example:
      </p>

<source class="prettyprint">java.util.stream.Stream
import org.apache.commons.statistics.descriptive.Variance;

// Support a fixed size array
double[] values = {1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21};

double v = Variance.of(values).getAsDouble();

// Support streams
double v2 = Stream.of("one", "two", "three", "four")
                  .mapToDouble(String::length)
                  .collect(Variance::create, Variance::accept, Variance::combine)
                  .getAsDouble();
